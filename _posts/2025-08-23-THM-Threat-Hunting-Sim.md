# TryHackMe: Threat Hunting Simulation Walkthrough

### Threat intel:

-------

#### Executive Summary:

Issued by: TryDetectThis Intelligence

Classification: Internal – TLP:AMBER

TryDetectThis Intelligence has identified a coordinated supply chain attack campaign targeting open-source ecosystems, specifically, npm and Python package repositories. The campaign appears to be orchestrated by a threat actor leveraging long-term infiltration of neglected or low-profile projects to weaponize legitimate packages.

The attacker’s strategy involves contributing to moderately used but under-maintained libraries, gaining contributor or maintainer status through helpful commits. Once trusted, they publish malicious updates, embedding post-installation payloads or obfuscated backdoors within version releases that appear minor or maintenance-related.

These weaponized libraries often act as stagers for follow-on actions—such as downloading secondary payloads, establishing persistence, or exfiltrating tokens and credentials from developer machines. Due to their presence in tutorials, starter templates, or widely shared codebases, they have a high chance of spreading through organic adoption.

#### Threat Hunting Mission:

Your task as a Threat Hunter is to conduct a comprehensive hunting session in the TryGovMe environment to identify potential anomalies and threats. You are expected to:

1. Validate a Hunting Hypothesis \
Investigate the given hypothesis and determine - based on your findings - whether it is valid or not.

2. Review IOCs from External Sources \
Analyse the list of Indicators of Compromise provided by security teams from compromised partner organisations. These may lead you to uncover additional malicious activity or pivot points.

3. Reconstruct the Attack Chain \
Perform a detailed investigation within the environment and reconstruct the attack chain, starting from the initial point of compromise to the attacker's final objective.

4. Determine the Scope of the Incident \
Identify the impacted users, systems, and assets. Understanding the full scope is critical for response and containment.

5. Generate a Final Threat Hunting Report \
Based on your findings and the reconstructed attack chain, compile a final Threat Hunting report highlighting the key observations and affected entities.
